# Food Management

Food is critical. Obviously. But especially during quarantine times when there isn't enough excuse to ditch the cooking and go meet a friend and "end up" eating outside. 

Can no longer blame the toil from the daily work commute to justify ordering meals from outside in the evening.

The result, lots of cooking! Lots of grocery shopping online.

We wish to:
- keep track of the raw ingredients we have
- know our fav recipes that we can cook with the ingredients
- let us put dishes in a calendar
- allow us to discover recipes with the ingredients we have
